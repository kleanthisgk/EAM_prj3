# "IKA" Website Implementation

## About

  This is a **Computer - Human Interaction and Web Development** project, developed at **Fall of 2017** by **Evangelou Konstantinos, Gkergki Kleanthis** and **Kamaras Georgios** for the Computer - Human Interaction course. Our goal was to re-implement the Web Service of the Greek Social Security Administration _(in greek "IKA")_, which we had heuristically evaluated and then redesigned in the previous course's assignments.
